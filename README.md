# project-euler
1. Easy
2. Easy
3. Didn't really get it.
4. Easy
5. Easy (Used basic math, did not use any innbuilt functions from math library or brute forced everynumber to be divided by the given range. A better solution would be to use primes in someway).
6. Used the formulae.
7. Sieve of eratosthenes. CS5200 Gem5 simulation helped here lol.
8. Kind of Sliding window more of brute force. 
9. Meh, Math.
10. Tried Everything. I liked the implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes function more.
