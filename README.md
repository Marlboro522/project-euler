# project-euler

1. Easy
2. Easy
3. Didn't really get it.
4. Easy
5. Easy (Used basic math, did not use any innbuilt functions from math library or brute forced everynumber to be divided by the given range. A better solution would be to use primes in someway).
6. Used the formulae.
7. Sieve of eratosthenes. CS5200 Gem5 simulation helped here lol.
8. Kind of Sliding window more of brute force.
9. Meh, Math.
10. Tried Everything. I liked the implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes function more.
11. Just some array things
12. Need to optimize this somehow.
13. math
14. Too many sequences in the same pattern, memoization or caching would be more efficient.The sequences appear as the number grows large, coupling this with a recursive approach should significantly improve time.
15. WTF is even that ? Math or brute force ?
